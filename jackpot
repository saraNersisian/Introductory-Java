Problem:
 This program is like a jackpot. 
 It asks user to pick a number between 0-20 and then it rolls a dice, if the picked number was the random number that dice shows then they win. If not, they lose, and the program gives them another last chance.
If they win, it will roll the dice again and the number would be their prize, for an even number, the program doubles the price, for an odd number it gives the same amount as the odd number itself.


Pseudocode:
1)	Create variables guess1 and rand
2)	Ask user to input a number between 0-20 
3)	With do while loop make them to pick a number In range
4)	Save the number in variable name guess1
5)	The display the games rolls and information “I will roll a dice and if you get lucky and it turned to guess1. You are a WINNER! For your prize I will roll the dice again! If the number was an EVEN number, I will multiply it by 2. If it was an ODD number, then i would give you the odd number’s amount itself! If you lost first time, DON'T WORRY! I will give you one more chance!”
6)	Then roll the dice and display the winning number
7)	If it was the number that user picked, then go to the method name winner
8)	Winner method shows that they win and will show them their prize by rolling the dice again and doubling it if it was an even number or leave it as is if it was an odd number
9)	If the winning number wasn’t equal to the user guess, then go to the method name secondChance
10)	In secondChance method, give them another chance picking a number in range and roll the dice
11)	If they failed, then say sorry you have lost
12)	If they win then go to winner method
