/* Pseudocode:
1)import java.util.Scanner
2)create variables: X and Y
3)create new scanner to get the input from user
4)ask the user to enter x and y coordinates in order to see if the point is in the rectangle
5)save the first input in variable named x 
6)save the next input in variable named y
7)with if else condition, see if the x that user entered is between -2.6 and 2.5
8)and if in the same time y is between -5 and 5
9)if yes, then show that the point is in the rectangle
10)if not then show that it is not in the rectangle
11)done.
