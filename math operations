Problem: 
This program is getting 2 numbers from user and do the operation as they choose.

Pseudocode:
1) create variables named: userInput1, userInput2, choice and result
2) ask the user to input to integer numbers between 0 and 1000
3) get the 2 numbers and save them in variables named userInput1 and userInput2
4) see if they entered a valid number in the range
5) if yes then continue with showing them 5 options of whether they want to do addition, subtraction, multiplication, division or quit
6) show the result as they pick which case they want
7) put an error message if they entered an invalid case or number

Code:

import java.util.Scanner;

public class lab3
{
 public static void main (String [] args )
 {
 double userInput1;
 double userInput2;
 int choice;
 double result;
 
   Scanner keyboard=new Scanner (System.in);

 System.out.println("Choose 2 integer numbers between 0 and 1000 ( \nnote:the second number should be bigger than the first one");
 
 userInput1= keyboard.nextDouble();
 userInput2= keyboard.nextDouble();

 if (userInput2<userInput1)
 { 
 System.out.println("ERROR! ( the second input should be bigger than the first one");
 }
 
 else if  (userInput1>=0 && userInput1<=1000 && userInput2>=0 && userInput2<=1000 )
 {
   System.out.println("You can choose one of the operations:");
   System.out.println("1)Addition");
   System.out.println("2)Subtraction");
   System.out.println("3)Multiplication");
   System.out.println("4)Division");
   System.out.println("5)Quite");
   
 choice=keyboard.nextInt();
 
  switch (choice)
  {
  case 1:
   result=userInput1+userInput2;
   System.out.println("the result is : "+ result);
  break;
   
  case 2:
   result=userInput2-userInput1;
   System.out.println("the result is : "+ result);
  break;
  
  case 3:
   result=userInput1*userInput2;
   System.out.println("the result is : "+ result);
  break;
  
  case 4:
   result=userInput2/userInput1;
   System.out.printf("the result is : %.2f",result);
  break;
  
  case 5:
  System.out.println("You have chosen to quit the program.");
  
  default:
  System.out.println(" Invalid choice!");
  
  }
 }
  
  else 
   System.out.println ("you have chosen a number out of range!");
   
 }
}
  

   
                      
Output:
 ----jGRASP exec: java lab3

You can choose one of the operations:
1)Addition
2)Subtraction
3)Multiplication
4)Division
5)Quite
