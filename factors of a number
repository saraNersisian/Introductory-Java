Problem:
This program is printing factors of any integer number that user inputs.
Pseudocode:
1)	Create variables number and i and assign 1 for their values
2)	Display a message asking user to input a number to see its factors
3)	Check while i is less than or equal to the number do following
4)	See if the modules of number over i is 0 (meaning it’s a factor)
5)	Print i
6)	Then out of it statement increase i by 1 and continue
7)	done


Code:
import java.util.Scanner;

public class factor
{
 public static void main (String [] args)
 {
 int number=1;
 int i=1;
 
  Scanner keyboard=new Scanner (System.in);
 
 System.out.println("Enter a number to see its factors");
 
 number=keyboard.nextInt();
 System.out.println("The Factors of "+number+" are: ");

 while(i<=number)
 {
  if (number%i==0)
  { 
  System.out.printf(" \n%d ",i);
  }
  i++;
  }
 }
}
Output:
